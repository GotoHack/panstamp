*The stack, the core of the panStamps*

= Introduction =

The panStamp stack is the firmware behind the scenes. It's primarily formed by a public set of functions, variables and, the most important, all the automatic procedures that deal with the SWAP protocol.

= Functionality =

The stack is responsible of doing the following tasks:

 * Listening to the wireless SWAP network
 * Parsing incoming SWAP packets
 * Transmission of SWAP packets
 * Automatic generation of responses to incoming SWAP commands and queries
 * Management of registers, including updates and external control
 * Control of the internal state machine
 * Power management
 * Storage of configuration registers in EEPROM

All the above features provide a high degree of isolation between network communications, endpoint management and user code. In fact, the main goal of using this stack is letting the user concentrate on developing the application whilst the stack does the rest.
