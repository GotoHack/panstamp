*The stack, the core of the panStamps*

= Introduction =

The panStamp stack is the firmware behind the scenes. It's primarily formed by a public set of functions, variables and, the most important, all the automatic procedures that deal with the SWAP protocol.

== Functionality ==

The stack is responsible of doing the following tasks:

 * Listening to the wireless SWAP network
 * Parsing incoming SWAP packets
 * Transmission of SWAP packets
 * Automatic generation of responses to incoming SWAP commands and queries
 * Management of registers, including updates and external control
 * Control of the internal state machine
 * Power management
