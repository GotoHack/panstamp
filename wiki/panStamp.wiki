= panStamp: technical details =

= Pin mapping =
Sample sketches and libraries use either the Arduino pin naming, panStamp pin numbers or Atmega's port register/masks. Depending on the library being used and the degree of control to be achieved over the microcontroller I/O's, you'll find any of the mentioned conventions.

= Voltage range =
panStamps have to be powered between 2.5 VDC and 3.6VDC

= Bootloader =

panStamps come with the Arduino bootloader preinstalled. Fuse values are listed here:

 * Extended = 0x05
 * High = 0xD8
 * Low = 0xE2
