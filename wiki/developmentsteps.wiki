*Steps to be done during the development of a new SWAP device*

= Introduction =

This tutorial explains some basic steps to follow during the development of new SWAP devices. If you base your development on a panStamp or any other Arduino-based platform and you follow this guide, you will surely find this process quite straightforward.

= Design process =

== Step 1: Choose your hardware ==

Choose your preferred sensors, power source and actuators that fit your design. Identify your endpoints and configuration parameters. Decide how you want to group these values in panStamp's register table.

== Step 2: Create your Arduino sketch ==

Create a new Arduino sketch based on [this template]. Then make the necessary modifications, as explained below:
