*Steps to be done during the development of a new SWAP device*

= Introduction =

This tutorial explains some basic steps to follow during the development of new SWAP devices. If you base your development on a panStamp or any other Arduino-based platform and you follow this guide, you will surely find this process quite straightforward.

= Design process =

== Step 1: Choose your hardware ==

Choose your preferred sensors, power source and actuators that fit your design. Identify your endpoints and configuration parameters. Decide how you want to group these values in panStamp's register table.

== Step 2: Create your Arduino sketch ==

Create a new Arduino sketch based on any of the existing sketches. Try to choose the sketch that best suits your application. Then make the necessary modifications, as explained below:

=== product.h: specify your product code ==

*product.h* contains some fields that need to be filled in order to make your device identifiable from the SWAP network. Manufacturer ID and Product ID are the most important ones. Remember to use your unique Manufacturer ID, provided during the member registration process. Product ID can take any 4-byte value but remember to never use the same ID for two different products.

=== regtable.ino: create your custom registers ===

*regtable.ino* is the place where to define your custom registers and their behaviour.
