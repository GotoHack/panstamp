#summary How to run Lagarto on Raspberry Pi
#labels Phase-Deploy

= Introduction =

Lagarto can be run on a Raspberry Pi. Either you can install everything from scratch or you could download our image based on Raspbian which includes Lagarto-SWAP, Lagarto-MAX and an OpenRemote version which can be integrated with Lagarto.

= Getting started =

  # Download the latest image here: http://www.panstamp.org/lagarto_images/lagarto_rpi_0.3_8gb.img.zip
  # Unzip and write the image to the SD card (at least 8 GB) according to the [http://elinux.org/RPi_Easy_SD_Card_Setup#Copying_the_image_to_an_SD_Card_on_Windows Raspberry Pi Wiki]:
    * For Windows, use [http://sourceforge.net/projects/win32diskimager/ Win32 Disk Imager]
    * For Linux, use `dd if=lagarto_rpi_0.2_4gb.img of=/dev/sdc`
  # Insert the SD card in your Raspberry Pi and boot it up.
  # Once started, you should be able access:
    * http://192.168.1.22:8001 for Lagarto-SWAP
    * http://192.168.1.22:8002 for Lagarto-MAX
  # You can also SSH to it using username lagarto and the same password.


= Raspberry Pi configuration = 

  * To change IP-address, edit *`/etc/network/interfaces`*
  * To change which DNS servers to use, edit *`/etc/resolv.conf`*


= Raspberry Pi updates = 

Between each Raspberry Pi, Lagarto applications will probably get updated. To update your applications, ssh to the Raspberry Pi

{{{
cd ~/panStamp/lagarto/
sudo svn update
}}}


= Raspberry Pi re-install = 

If you decide to re-install your Raspberry Pi, you might want to backup your current configuration.

For *Lagarto-SWAP*, you need to backup:
  * `~/panStamp/lagarto/lagarto-swap/config/swapnet.json`
  * `~/panStamp/lagarto/lagarto-swap/config/network.xml`
  * `~/panStamp/lagarto/lagarto-swap/config/serial.xm`

For *Lagarto-MAX*, you need to backup:
  * `to be added`


= Raspberry Pi version history = 

  * 0.1: Initial release.
  * 0.2: Including autostart och Lagarto.
  * 0.3: Including OpenRemote.
