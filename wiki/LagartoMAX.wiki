= Lagarto-MAX: extended automation client =

= Introduction =

Lagarto-MAX is a lagarto client that receives and processes events transmitted from any lagarto server running on the same IP network. Lagarto-MAX is a key piece into the lagarto architecture since it's able to integrate real values belonging to different networks and present them to the user in a homogeneous way. Moreover, being user-programmable, Lagarto-MAX can take decisions based on time or network events.

= Features =

Lagarto-MAX, due to its nature, is one of those components that will be continuously growing in functionalities. The following is a list of features provided by this lagarto client:

 * Reception of network events from any lagarto server on the same IP network (LAN or Internet)
 * Transmission of commands to any lagarto server on the same IP network (LAN or Internet)
 * Common web control/monitoring interface for all lagarto endpoints
 * Event manager entirely programmable from the Web interface
 * Automatic upload of values to different cloud data services (Pachube, ThingSpeak, ...)
 * Simple thread-independent interface for running user Python scripts.
 * Python API for managing values such as "get_value" or "set_value"

= Configuration =

Lagarto-MAX is entirely configured from the web interface. Default HTTP port is 8002 so in order to access the web interface we have to open the following URL:

http:\\ip_address:8002

== Lagarto settings ==

Every lagarto process needs some configuration parameters to be edited from this page:

 * process name: name of the lagarto process. This name has to be unique across all lagarto process
 * Broadcast channel: TCP/IP address and port to be used for notifications. This channel must be the same for all lagarto processes.
 * HTTP server port: unique for each lagarto process running in the same machine.Default value is 8002.

= Event programming =

Programming events from the web interface is simple and intuitive. The _Event Panel_ lists all the programmed events and lets us create new ones by pressing the "New Event" button:
