One of the great things about the CC430 processor is that digital functions (green lines) can be moved to any P1 or P2 pin. Green text shows the default position of these functions.

= Info memory =

CC430 processors do not include EEPROM space. Instead, they provide a special region in Flash for storing configurations. This region is called info memory and is 512 bytes long in the CC430F5137 MCU.
